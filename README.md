# Bus Live Map for CSUEB Shuttle
hello world

This is a web application for tracking the real time position of shuttles of California State University, East Bay using Flask and Kafka.

Notice that to provide data as placeholder for actual bus geolocation, we set up json files as temporary data sources.
